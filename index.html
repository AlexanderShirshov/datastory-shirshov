      <h2>General Overiew of the Class and Projects </h2>

      <h3> Throughout the semester I created several items including data
        collection, visualization, explained video and finally the personal
        datastory site. Of these, the data visualization was by far my favorite
        and took up a disproportional amount of the careful attention alloted
        between the specific items. I increased my understanding of the key
        intuitions and skills taught through each of the projects, discussed later.
        The class itself proved to be engaging. Different style of group activities,
        reviews, lectures and homework that came together to show novel perspectives
        on the topics at hand.

          <h3>Data Collection made by Alexander Shirshov</h3>
          <p> Determining the main topic of data collection was an easy step as I
            had previous interest in understanding how much time I spent reading
            about Formula 1 in general, and if my reading habits reflected my interest
            in my favorite team within the sport overall.
          </p>
          <p>With the topic determined, I had to figure out an easy way to track
            my reading habbits. This was eventually done through a screen capture app
            on my phone combined with on screen notes. Each time an article was read,
            a screen capture was taken when first openign the article and when reaching
            the bottom. Notes were writen on the later screen capture for that article.
            These notes denoted in short hand how long the article took to read and if
             continued on to another article from the suggestions shown below. The before
             and after screen capture helped determine how long it took me to read, with
             other information also being part of the image including date and time.
          </p>
          <p> Data iteself was organized as seen on right. Conditional formatting
            was used to help see key aspects at a glance (e.g. whether the article
            was read, what team it was mainly about) and comments were included for all
            variables collected (denoted in column names at top).

          <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
          <p> The visualization on the right displays my reading habbits of Formula 1
              stories as agregated form the data collection described above. It
              uses a set of differing and multi layerd (in meaning) marks in
              combination with visualization of time before and after a race event.
            </p>
          <p> Marks are differet for irepresenting related news read before, during
              and after a Formula 1 (F1) race. Marks are patterned different for whether
              an article was read, skimmed, or simply viewed in abstract. Further, marks
              are coloured to denote the Formula 1 team that the news story largely focused
              on.
              </p>
          <p> Visually, the marks are designed to look like air currents as they flow
              around the race car at high speeds. In wind tunnel testing of cars, smoke is
              often used to demonstrate the air efficiency of a car. here, the marks change
              shape to represent whether they are before the air hits the car, while its flowing
              smoothly along side, and as it ruffles behind it. Of course, this shape denotes if the
              news story was read before, drign or after as well, previously discussed.
              </p>
          <p> To aid in identifying the marks and adding more granualarity to how many days
              before and after a race a story was read (for an two maximum days before and after
              any particular race day) areas before and after the car are noted in grey boxes. these
              grey boxes are designed to look like the edges of the race track as seen in some photos.

            <h3>Astroturfing Explained Video</h3>
        <p> Out group chose Astroturfing as the topic of our explained video.
            None of us had any previous experience in learnign about what it was
            nor did we know of how it may affect ourselves and others in everyday
            life.
            </p>
        <p> Astrotufing can be easily defined as spreading fake reviews on the internet.
            For a more complex definition can be found on dictionary.com, paraphrased as a
            deceptive tactic for creating fake grassroots movements with a specific interest
            in shaping public opinion about a particular topic in one direction or another.
            </p>
        <p> The structure of the explain video was as follows:
          <li>
            Scene 1 - Overall introduction to the video topic
            </li>
          <li>
            Scene 2 - General explanation of astroturfing
            </li>
          <li>
            Scene 3 - Examples of astrotufing both hypothetical and in the real
            world
            </li>
          <li>
            Scene 4 - A tangential topic explanation of cyberturfing, a modern
            equivalent of astrotufing
            </li>
          <li>
            Scene 5 - Examples specific to cyberturfing that relate to everyday
            internet users
            </li>
          <li>
            Scene 6 - Conclusion and review of topics covered
            </li>
              </p>
        <p>
           In the end, our motivation for understand the topic helped us in
           the initial stages of creating the explained video. We had well put together
           research and ended up with a problem of too much information to be put
           into the format of a short video. After several revisions to our script we were
           boiled it down to the key facts.
